Widget-based web GUI package intended to support the
`LiberTEM <https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/>`_
library for electron microscopy data analysis. The primary
usage environment is from within Jupyter Notebooks. Built using
the `Panel <https://panel.holoviz.org/>`_ and `Bokeh <https://bokeh.org/>`_
frameworks.

Runs LiberTEM User Defined Functions (UDFs) in interactive
panels, which simplies adjustment of parameters and exploring
data.

The framework is capable of running certain analyses on top of the
`LiberTEM-live <https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM-live/>`_
framework, allowing for interactive live acquisitions
in a Jupyter Notebook.

There are two ways to use the UI tools:

* as standalone analysis windows connected to a dataset
* through a :code:`UIContext` window manager, which can
  dynamically add and remove windows as required

The standalone case (where :code:`ctx`, :code:`ds` are
LiberTEM `Context` and `DataSet` objects):

.. code-block:: python

    from libertem_ui.windows.com import CoMImagingWindow
    # Create the window using a context and dataset
    com_window = CoMImagingWindow.using(ctx, ds)
    # Display the window itself
    com_window.layout()
    # Results from the window are stored in a dataframe-based results manager
    # This provides a GUI result browser using a .layout() method
    com_window.results_manager.layout()
    # Results in the manager can be extracted into Python objects using methods
    result_id = '3kd9sn'
    rc = com_window.results_manager.get_result_container(result_id)
    assert isinstance(rc.data, np.ndarray)

A second standalone window can be linked to the first,
and will share the data and LiberTEM resources. Results from
both windows will appear in the same :code:`results_manager`.

.. code-block:: python

    from libertem_ui.windows.imaging import VirtualDetectorWindow
    # Create new window linked to the previous window
    v_window = VirtualDetectorWindow.linked_to(com_window)
    # Display the new window
    v_window.layout()

When two-or-more windows are linked, certain results can be displayed
in other windows to help navigate the data. For example, a log-sum over
all frames generated by the :code:`FrameImagingWindow` can be displayed
in the :code:`VirtualDetectorWindow` frame plot, to help parametrize an
annular darkfield analysis.

For a more tightly-integrated experience, the managed :code:`UIContext`
can dynamically add and remove windows, as well as run analyses
from multiple windows in parallel:

.. code-block:: python

    from libertem_ui.api import UIContext

    # Create the UIContext object
    # This orchestrates:
    #  - add/remove analysis windows
    #  - providing work to the LiberTEM Context
    #  - managing and saving results from analyses
    ui_context = UIContext.for_offline(ctx, ds)
    # Display main window for running analyses
    ui_context.layout()
    # Display table / dataframe-based results manager
    ui_context.results_manager.layout()

see :code:`examples/` for some more complete example use cases.

Installation
------------

:code:`libertem_ui` requires Python 3.10 or greater.

As always, it is advisable to use a virtual or conda environment
for testing packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install libertem-ui

The optional dependencies `libertem-ui[libertem]` and `libertem-ui[notebook]`
install the necessary components to run LiberTEM windows and Jupyter notebooks,
respectively.


Disclaimer
----------

:code:`LiberTEM-panel-ui` is at an early proof-of-concept stage. All interfaces
and functionality is subject to change in the future. Notably, the primary usage
environment is in a Jupyter Notebook - standalone usage as a web app through
:code:`panel serve` is not well tested.

If you are interested in the project and would like to see it taken further,
please don't hesitate to get in touch by posting an
